# Phase 1: Core Provider Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary

Successfully implemented Phase 1 of the audio transcription feature with AssemblyAI and Firebase Storage integration.

## Key Achievements

### 1. AssemblyAI Integration
- **File**: `server/modules/transcription/infrastructure/providers/assemblyai_provider.go`
- **Features**: 
  - Full integration with standalone `assemblyai-go` package
  - Speaker diarization support using AssemblyAI's speaker labeling
  - Audio upload to Firebase Storage before transcription
  - Polling mechanism for transcript completion
  - Conversion of AssemblyAI utterances to domain transcript segments

### 2. Firebase Storage Integration  
- **File**: `server/modules/transcription/infrastructure/providers/firebase_uploader.go`
- **Features**:
  - Secure audio file uploads to Firebase Storage
  - Signed URL generation for access control
  - Stream-based uploads for large files
  - Organized file structure: `meetings/{meetingID}/audio/{sessionID}_{timestamp}.wav`

### 3. Mock Provider for Development
- **File**: `server/modules/transcription/infrastructure/providers/assemblyai_mock.go` 
- **Features**:
  - Realistic mock transcription with speaker diarization
  - Firebase Storage integration for testing
  - Configurable mock data and processing delays

### 4. Smart Provider Factory
- **File**: `server/modules/transcription/application/services/audio_processor_factory.go`
- **Features**:
  - Automatic provider selection based on environment configuration
  - Graceful fallback to mock when API keys are missing
  - Provider capability validation
  - Firebase Storage initialization with error handling

### 5. Standalone Package Structure
- **Package**: `assemblyai-go/` (standalone module)
- **Integration**: Proper Go module dependency with replace directive
- **Import**: `github.com/therealchrisrock/assemblyai-go`

## WebSocket API Ready

The existing WebSocket endpoint (`/ws/audio`) now supports:
- **Speaker Diarization**: `?speaker_diarization=true`
- **Provider Selection**: `?provider=assemblyai` or `?provider=mock`
- **Processing Modes**: `?mode=batch` or `?mode=realtime`
- **Language Selection**: `?language=en`

## Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **Audio Upload**: Audio chunks are concatenated and uploaded to Firebase Storage  
✅ **AssemblyAI Processing**: Audio files are submitted to AssemblyAI with diarization enabled  
✅ **Speaker Diarization**: Transcript segments include speaker identification  
✅ **Domain Integration**: Results are converted to domain entities (`TranscriptSegment`)  
✅ **Firebase Storage**: Audio files are securely stored and accessible via signed URLs  

## Environment Configuration

The system supports both development (mock) and production (real APIs) modes:

```env
# Production mode (with real APIs)
ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=your-key
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-bucket
FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=./firebase-credentials/serviceAccountKey.json

# Development mode (mock providers)
# (No API keys needed - automatic fallback)
```

## Testing Status

- ✅ **Compilation**: Server builds successfully with all dependencies
- ✅ **Module Resolution**: `assemblyai-go` package properly integrated
- ✅ **Provider Factory**: Smart provider selection working
- ✅ **WebSocket API**: Endpoints configured for both real and mock providers

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. **Database Integration**
   - Create repository implementations for transcription persistence
   - Link transcriptions to meetings and participants
   - Store Firebase URLs and transcript metadata

2. **Real-time Processing**
   - Implement AssemblyAI real-time streaming API
   - Add live transcript updates via WebSocket
   - Handle partial transcript segments

3. **Event System**
   - Publish events after transcription completion
   - Trigger semantic analysis pipeline
   - Integrate with action item extraction

The transcription feature foundation is now solid and ready for the next phase of development!
