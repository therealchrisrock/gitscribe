# Resources

The best resource we have to offer regarding building browser extensions is our book, [Building Multi-Platform Browser Extensions](https://serversideup.net/building-multi-platform-browser-extensions/). We go through the whole process and provide templates to get you up and running. All templates use `webext-bridge` and we have tutorials for quite a few common issues that come up.

- **[Discord](https://serversideup.net/discord)** for friendly support from the community and the team.
- **[GitHub](https://github.com/serversideup/webext-bridge)** for source code, bug reports, and project management.
- **[Get Professional Help](https://serversideup.net/professional-support)** - Get video + screen-sharing help directly from the core contributors.
