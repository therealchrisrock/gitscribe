# Examples

Here are a few common examples of how to use the `webext-bridge` package to communicate within your extension. There are way more possibilities, this should give a quick overview on how it all works together.

## sendMessage() and onMessage()
Of the 6 available methods, the [sendMessage()](/docs/api/send-message) and the [onMessage()](/docs/api/on-message) methods are the most commonly used. Let's quickly go over these methods so the examples make a little more sense.

The [sendMessage()](/docs/api/send-message) method actually sends the message and will be the same no matter what context you are importing it. This method will accept 3 parameters:
- `messageId` - ID of the message that we are sending. I usually set this to an uppercase enum or string value so it's easy to listen for and makes sense.
- `data` - JSON data to send along with the message. Used for processing.
- `destination` - The destination is where we are sending the message to, such as `background`, `popup`, `content-script@{tabId}`, etc.

Next, we have the [`onMessage()`](/docs/api/on-message) method which listens to an incoming message targeted. The two parameters accepted by this method are:
- `messageId` - ID of the message are listening to. This matches the `messageId` from the `sendMessage()` method.
- `callback` - The callback function used to handle the method.

There are other methods that are exposed as well, but they are all built off of these two methods. All methods are documented in the [API](/docs/api/send-message).


## Popup -> Background Script
In this example, we send a message from the popup to the background script.

One thing to note. In all examples, we decouple the `{data}` in the `onMessage()` handler. You don't have to do that. For the most part, it's all you really need access too. However, the `callback` method accepts a JSON object that contains a little more information and is constructed like this:

::code-panel
---
label: Parameter received by the `onMessage()` callback
---
```json
{
    "sender": {
        "context": "popup", // could be any other context
        "tabId": null,
        "frameId": null
    },
    "id": "MESSAGE_ID",
    "data": {},
    "timestamp": 1701876927787
}
```
::

This can be extremely helpful when figuring out where the message came from. I've used the sender.context to determine where the message came from in order to determine the response in some extensions.

::code-panel
---
label: Popup
---
```javascript
import { sendMessage } from "webext-bridge/popup";

const sendToBackground = async () => {
    await sendMessage("RECORD_NAME", {
        first_name: 'John',
        last_name: 'Doe'
    }, "background");
}
```
::

::code-panel
---
label: Background
---
```javascript
import { onMessage } from "webext-bridge/background";

onMessage( "RECORD_NAME", recordName );
async function recordName( {data} ){
    // Do whatever processing you need here. 
    return {
        // Some response here
    }; 
}
```

## Popup -> Content Script

This example sends a message from the background to a content script. One SUPER important piece to point out, is when messaging a content script, you need to add the `tabId` where the script is located to the end of the destination. 

If you aren't using the [webextension-polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webextension-polyfill) package, I'd highly recommend it. Otherwise you will have to write an individual extension for each browser you want to support. In this example, we are using the polyfill and referencing the browser through `browser.` (the alternative would be `chrome.`).

::code-panel
---
label: Popup
---
```javascript
import { sendMessage } from "webext-bridge/popup";

function sendToContentScript{
    let tabs = await browser.tabs.query({
        active: true,
        currentWindow: true
    });

    const response = await sendMessage("RECORD_NAME", { 
        first_name: 'John',
        last_name: 'Doe'
    }, "content-script@"+tabs[0].id);
}
```
::

Note, we are querying the active tab in the current window to grab the `tabId`. Feel free to use whatever method you need to get the `tabId`

::code-panel
---
label: Content
---
```javascript
import { onMessage } from "webext-bridge/content-script";

onMessage( "RECORD_NAME", recordName );
async function recordName( {data} ){
    // Do whatever processing you need here. 

    return {
        // Some response here
    }; 
}
```
::


## Content Script -> Background Script
This example sends a message from the content script to the background script.

::code-panel
---
label: Content
---
```javascript
import { sendMessage } from "webext-bridge/content-script";

const sendToBackground = async () => {
    const response = await sendMessage('RECORD_NAME', {
        first_name: 'John',
        last_name: 'Doe'
    }, 'background'); 

    // Handle response
}
```
::

::code-panel
---
label: Background
---
```javascript
import { onMessage } from "webext-bridge/background";

onMessage( "RECORD_NAME", recordName );
async function recordName( {data} ){
    // Do whatever processing you need here. 

    return {
        // Some response here
    }; 
}
```
