# allowWindowMessaging()

::warning
Caution: Dangerous action
::

API available only to content scripts

Unlocks the transmission of messages to and from `window` (top frame of loaded page) contexts in the tab where it is called.

`webext-bridge` by default won't transmit any payload to or from `window` contexts for [security](/docs/guide/security) reasons.

This method can be called from a content script (in top frame of tab), which opens a gateway for messages.

Once again, `window` = the top frame of any tab. That means **allowing window messaging without checking origin first** will let JavaScript loaded at `https://evil.com` talk with your extension and possibly give indirect access to things you won't want to, like `history` API. You're expected to ensure the safety and privacy of your extension's users.

## `namespace`

**Required** | `string`

Can be a domain name reversed like `com.github.facebook.react_devtools` or any `uuid`. Call `setNamespace` in `window` context with same value, so that `webext-bridge` knows which payload belongs to which extension (in case there are other extensions using `webext-bridge` in a tab). Make sure namespace string is unique enough to ensure no collisions happen.
