# openStream()
::note
The following API is built on top of `sendMessage` and `onMessage`, basically, it's just a wrapper, the routing and security rules still apply the same way.
::

Opens a `Stream` between caller and destination.

Returns a `Promise` which resolves with `Stream` when the destination is ready (loaded and `onOpenStreamChannel` callback registered).

## `channel`

**Required** | `string`

`Stream`(s) are strictly scoped `sendMessage`(s). Scopes could be different features of your extension that need to talk to the other side, and those scopes are named using a channel id.

## `destination`

**Required** | `string`

Same as `destination` in [`sendMessage(msgId, data, destination)`](/docs/api/send-message)
