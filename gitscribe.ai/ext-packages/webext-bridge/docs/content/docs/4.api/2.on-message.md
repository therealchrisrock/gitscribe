# onMessage()

Register one and only one listener, per messageId per context. That will be called upon `sendMessage` from other side.

Optionally, send a response to sender by returning any value or if async a `Promise`.

## `messageId`

**Required** | `string`

Any `string` that both sides of your extension agree on. Could be `get-flag-count` or `getFlagCount` or `GET_FLAG_COUNT`, as long as it's same in sender's `sendMessage` call.

## `callback`

**Required** | `fn`

A callback function `webext-bridge` should call when a message is received with same `messageId`. The callback function will be called with one argument, a `message` which has `sender`, `data` and `timestamp` as its properties.

Optionally, this callback can return a value or a `Promise`, resolved value will sent as reply to sender.
