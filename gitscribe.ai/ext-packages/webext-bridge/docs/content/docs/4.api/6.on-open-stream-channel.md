# onOpenStreamChannel()
::note
The following API is built on top of `sendMessage` and `onMessage`, basically, it's just a wrapper, the routing and security rules still apply the same way.
::

Registers a listener for when a `Stream` opens. Only one listener per channel per context.

## `channel`

**Required** | `string`

`Stream`(s) are strictly scoped `sendMessage`(s). Scopes could be different features of your extension that need to talk to the other side, and those scopes are named using a channel id.

## `callback`

**Required** | `fn`

Callback that should be called whenever `Stream` is opened from the other side. Callback will be called with one argument, the `Stream` object, documented below.

`Stream`(s) can be opened by a malicious webpage(s) if your extension's content script in that tab has called `allowWindowMessaging`, if working with sensitive information use `isInternalEndpoint(stream.info.endpoint)` to check, if `false` call `stream.close()` immediately.
